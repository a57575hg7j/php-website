# Simple PHP Website

This repository contains a minimal example of a PHP website with three pages:

- `index.php` – Home page with a greeting based on the current time.
- `about.php` – Simple about page.
- `contact.php` – Contact form (demo only, no real email sending).
- `style.css` – Basic styling.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a57575hg7j/php-website.git
   ```
2. Place the files in a directory served by a PHP‑enabled web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx with PHP‑FPM).
3. Access the site via `http://localhost/php-website/index.php`.

Feel free to extend the site with more pages, a database, or any other features you need.
